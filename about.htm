<p  style="text-align: justify;">The African Centre for Pharmacovigilance (ACC), is a not-for-profit foundation coordinating the public, governmental, non-governmental and private sector initiatives in pharmacovigilance of three leading, pharmacovigilance organisations – the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Advocacy and Training in Pharmacovigilance (WHO-CC) of the University of Ghana; the African Union/NEPAD Regional Centre of Regulatory Excellence (RCORE) in Pharmacovigilance and Pharmaco-epidemiology of which the WHO-CC is the lead partner in a consortium involving several other agencies including the National Pharmacovigilance Centres at the National Regulatory Authorities of Ghana (FDA), Nigeria (NAFDAC), Tanzania (TFDA) and Zimbabwe (MCAZ) as well as Quintiles Clyndepharm of South Africa (part of Quintiles, the world’s largest clinical research organisation) and Sante-Afrique International Limited, the parent organisation in contract with the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Sweden for pharmacovigilance development in Africa.</p>
<p  style="text-align: justify;">
ACC was incorporated to provide a one-stop location for all things pharmacovigilance in Africa. Its vision is an Africa where patients are safe and where there is continuous, dynamic, world-class safety monitoring of all medical products including medicines, herbal remedies, vaccines and medical devices and all other health commodities. This would be achieved through training, advocacy, appropriate collaborations, capacity building and research.</p>
<p  style="text-align: justify;">
Pharmacovigilance in Africa has come a long way from the missing quarter century (1968-1992) where there was absolutely no African country in full membership of the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring (PIDM), through the lean years (1999-2005) to the current state where there are 35 African members of the PIDM and where discussions of pharmacovigilance has moved from data collection to the tools needed for data analysis and periodic benefit-risk evaluation.
ACC is the voice of pharmacovigilance in Africa and welcomes collaborations and partnerships of all stakeholders in pharmacovigilance in Africa. When it comes to pharmacovigilance in Africa, the organisation to contact for training, capacity building, tools, methods, research, advocacy, country support and communication is the African Collaborating Centre for Pharmacovigilance (ACC), Accra, Ghana. ACC is in Africa and for Africa but will always work and collaborate with the global community since pharmacovigilance is a global science and requires international collaboration at all levels.</p>
