            <h3 class="usa-footer-contact-heading">Fosun Pharma and African Collaborating Centre (ACC) for Pharmacovigilance sign landmark safety surveillance deal</h3>
            <p>Guilin Pharmaceutical, Ltd, a subsidiary company of Fosun Pharma, the only manufacturer of WHO pre-qualified injectable artesunate, today signed an agreement with the African Collaborating Centre for Pharmacovigilance for worldwide pharmacovigilance of three of its products: Artesun (artesunate for injection), D-ARTEPP (fixed dose oral combination of Dihydroartemisnin+Piperaquine) and SPAQ-CO (oral formulation of Amodiaquine Sulphadoxine-Pyrimetamine).
            
Artesun is the first line drug used in treating patients with severe malaria whilst D-ARTEPP is used to treat uncomplicated malaria. SPAQ-CO is administered to children in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa during the “malaria season” to prevent malaria during and after the season, a treatment approach known as “seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)”.</p><p>
This agreement is the first of its kind inAfrica between a global pharmaceutical company and an African institutionspecialising in pharmacovigilance. Considering the fact that the World HealthOrganisation’s safety database has very little information on the safety of allmarketed products in Africa, this collaboration presents a huge opportunity toincrease the collection and sharing data of medicines used in Africa. The ACCconvenes the AU/NEPAD Regional Centre of Regulatory Excellence inPharmacovigilance and works extremely closely with the WHO Collaborating Centrefor Advocacy and Training in Pharmacovigilance, University of Ghana.
Speaking at the signing of the agreement, Dr Jean-Marc Bouchez, Chief Medical Officer of Guilin Pharmaceutical, Ltd, lauded the partnership and expressed the hope that African institutions will take lead in the safety monitoring of products used for endemic diseases in Africa like malaria. He pledged the support of Guilin Pharmaceutical, Ltd towards the building of national institutions for safety monitoring of products and invited other companies to join such initiatives in a bid to strengthen national health systems across Africa.<br />
Prof Alex Dodoo, Director of the AfricanCollaborating Centre for Pharmacovigilance welcomed the partnership and called on African scientists and health professionals to collaborate actively in the area of post-market safety surveillance of medicines, vaccines and other medical products used in Africa. He posited that a healthy and safe Africa is the responsibility of all Africans and all who collaborate with or work in Africa and encouraged governments and the private sector to explore innovative approaches to leverage resources for sustainable safety monitoring systems on the continent.</p>
